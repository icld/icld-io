## Ian Cameron Lyles

I am a programmer and designer from Portland, Oregon. I enjoy playing
music, mountain biking in the Pacific Northwest, and re-learning
everything with my sweet little daughter, who I call Goose. I have a
background in concert and event lighting design and have been lucky
enough to travel the world over. I love the challenge of helping other
creative people realize their wildest visions.
